<p><center>Puma has edged past arch rival Adidas to emerge as the top sportswear retailer in India.
Puma reported sales of Rs 1,157 crore for a period of 12 months ending December 2018 up from Rs 958 crore for the corresponding period a year ago. India is the only market globally where the German sports lifestyle brand has surged ahead of sportswear giants such as Nike and Adidas. The company, however, follows a calendar year, January-December, while others, including Nike and Adidas follow the financial year i.e. April-March.
Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden had earlier told TOI that India is expected to become one of the company’s top five markets by 2020 from being the eight largest in 2016. “2018 has been a great year for us. Globally there is huge momentum in the brand. We are making strong progress in both Sports Performance and Sport Style categories,” said Puma India MD Abhishek Ganguly.</center></p>
